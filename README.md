I designed and analyzed a propeller blade, conducting performance evaluations to determine thrust production. Using CAD software, I crafted a propeller prototype from lightweight balsa wood, which was tested at various pitch angles to assess efficiency. This project significantly enhanced my technical skills in CAD and finite element analysis (FEA), deepening my knowledge of structural design and material performance in aeronautical applications.
